## About

In Theory Games is building the world's first MMOGG (Massive Multiplayer Online Gambling Game).

The two thirds game is the first in a series of games built on the Inco Network using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE allows for computation on encrypted inputs which unlocks novel game mechanics not previously possible on-chain. For more information on the Inco Network and FHE please see their [docs](https://docs.inco.network/introduction/inco-network-introduction).

In Theory Games is an [@0xAkrasia](https://twitter.com/0xAkrasia) project. If you want to contribute please reach out to Akrasia on Twitter. Akrasia is actively looking for talented developers and game designers.

There is no In Theory Games token at this time.
